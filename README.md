# APUSH_Final_Project
My Final Project for APUSH talking about the story of America and how I relate to it

If you have some sort of software that can run c++ programs, you can use that to run the main.cpp and it should work fine. Else you can also use your computer's terminal/command prompt to run it as well.

# Running this project
Sadly I decided to use classes and OOP making it impossible to use the computer's base terminal/command prompt system to run this project. So the more viable method is to install some sort of IDE. For Mac users, installing Xcode in the Mac is a simple way for the code to work. For Windows, Microsoft Visual Studios is a good IDE.

Once installed, you can add these files into a project and run the main.cpp file. This should allow the project to work and you can play this game.
